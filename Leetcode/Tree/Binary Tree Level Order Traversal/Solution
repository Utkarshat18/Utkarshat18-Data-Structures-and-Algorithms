step 1 - created a ans vector to return the ans;
step 2 - if condition is for if the root value is already null then it will return empty vector
step 3 - created queue and initially added root element in it
step 4 - while loop will iterate until queue gets empty if the queue is empty it means done with the traversal
step 5 - in while loop taking size of queue,creating vector and pop that elment and also iterating for 
         loop and also adding left node and right node in queue repeating the whole process until we remain with empty queue
step 6 - insert small vector and insert into ans vector
